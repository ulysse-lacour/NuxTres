- Utilize Pinia for managing application state (e.g., game state, player data, UI settings)
- Create Pinia stores in the `stores/` directory using the `useStoreName()` naming convention
- Use these stores within your components to access and modify the application state
- No need to import the store, it will be auto-imported
