- Store GLSL shader files (vertex and fragment shaders) in a dedicated directory (e.g., `assets/shaders/`)
- Use the `vite-plugin-glsl` plugin (already installed) to import these shaders directly into your JavaScript/Vue code
- This allows you to write shaders in separate files with proper syntax highlighting
