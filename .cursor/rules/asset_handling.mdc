description: DESCRIPTION TO DO
alwaysApply: true

- Place static assets (images, models, textures, etc.) in the `public/` directory
- Reference these assets using absolute paths (e.g., `/images/my-texture.png`)
- For assets loaded dynamically within Three.js, consider using the `useLoader` composable from `@tresjs/cientos` for optimized loading and caching
